{"name":"Recommender System","tagline":"Collaborative Filtering","body":"## Description\r\nFor businesses it is important to have knowledge about what users enjoy buying in order to provide them with better shopping experience. For example, a person buying a new television may frequently buy a surge protector to go along with it. What a recommender system does calculate the probability that a person consuming an item would likely need. Providing an opportunity for the business to sell another item.\r\n\r\nFor this project we will be applying the same logic to movie recommendations. Given a history of what a user has watched, we will try to recommend items that they would also be interested in seeing.\r\n\r\n## Methods\r\n### Data Set\r\nThe data set used for this project comes from the GroupLens Movie data set of 1 million ratings ([GroupLens](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)). The dataset contains demographic information and rating data for over 6000 users for 4000 movies.\r\n\r\n### Methodology\r\nHere we explore the use of Collaborative filtering ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering)) in order to make our recommendations. Collaborative Filtering can be done with various methods. Our chosen methods was to do an item-item collaborative filtering which in essence says \"users who bought x also bought y\". This method first applies a similarity between items. There is then an option to do an additional user-based filtering to find individual recommendations, which we will also do.\r\n\r\nFor this use of item-based collaborative filtering, we'll be finding the similarity of the movies to each other by finding the Cosine Similarity between matrices. Denoted: \r\n![Similarity Function](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/e/4/4e45dc7ae582130813e804f793f24ead.png) Based on users reviews, the rated movies are turned into a matrix where each movie has a list of movies that are similar to them. These matrix rows are then compared to with each other to get a similarity rating.\r\n\r\nFrom there the user layer is applied which takes the user's seen movies and finds the movies most similar to the ones already watched. This list is then sorted by similarity rating and output to a file.\r\n\r\n## Results\r\nComing soon.\r\n## Discussion\r\nComing soon","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
